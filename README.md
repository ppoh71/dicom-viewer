Radiology Dicom Viewer

Web Project: Online Radiology DICOM Viewer

We’re developing a web-based DICOM viewer designed for radiologists, medical students, and researchers to access and view medical imaging studies directly in their browser. The platform supports standard DICOM files and provides essential tools such as zoom, pan, window leveling, and multi-slice navigation. Our goal is to offer a fast, secure, and user-friendly experience without the need for desktop software—making medical imaging more accessible from anywhere. Built with modern web technologies like JavaScript, WebAssembly, and DICOMweb, this project aims to bridge cloud storage, PACS systems, and real-time collaboration in one powerful viewer.
